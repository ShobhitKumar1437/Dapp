# 🗳️ Decentralized Voting DApp

This is a decentralized voting system DApp built on the Ethereum test network. It allows users to cast a vote for one of two options (A or B) using their government ID. Votes are stored on the blockchain through a smart contract, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts government ID input
- Offers two voting options: **A** and **B**
- Integrates with **MetaMask** for wallet connection and transaction signing
- Stores the vote on the Ethereum blockchain
- Displays transaction receipt upon successful voting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Solidity** (Smart Contracts)
- **Hardhat** (Development Environment)
- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **Ethers.js** (Blockchain Interaction)
- **MetaMask** (Wallet Integration)
- **Ethereum Testnet** (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia)

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User enters their **Government ID** in the input field.
2. The DApp displays two buttons: **Vote A** and **Vote B**.
3. User clicks one of the buttons to cast their vote.
4. MetaMask prompts the user to confirm the transaction.
5. Upon confirmation and transaction success:
   - The vote is recorded on the blockchain.
   - The transaction receipt is displayed on screen.
